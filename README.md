# Omega Sound
 Omega Sound is a Spotify clone designed to allow you to add/remove songs from your favorites and listen to them in the browser.
 
 ## Motivation 
  This app was built to practice working with a third party API and to integrate it into our own app. We chose Spotify because of the sheer amount of information available as well as its great documentation (which made life at least a littl bit easier)
  
 ## Tech Stack
* Ruby on Rails API back End
* Javascript Front End
* HTTParty gem to assist with calls to Spotify API
* Spotify API and connection to personal Spotify Premium Account
* Custom CSS

#### Unfortunately this app requires the connection to a Spotify Premium account to function. That being said here is a link to their documentation https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/
